
A Flutter application that fetches products from [fakestoreapi.com](https://fakestoreapi.com) using flutter_bloc for state management, and flutter_offline for checking connectivity.
For an explanation of how to check internet connectivity refer to [yassinebenkhay.com](https://yassinebenkhay.com)
I am planning to implement all the endpoints in [fakestoreapi.com](https://fakestoreapi.com) so keep an eye on this repo:)
